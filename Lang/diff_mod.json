			"Option_34_Info":					"{Maximum High Level Difference}
			
												Sets the maximum relative level difference (6...0) for generated monsters, as compared to base monster level. For example, if you set the value to +2, a stack of Griffins (level 3) will never be mixed together with Champions (level 6) or Angels (level 7). If you set the value to -6-low  and 6-high theoretically the full range of monsters is allowed for generation.",
