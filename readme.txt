 1. Main Features 

Advanced Classes Mod is a huge gameplay improving modification based on the Wake of Gods. The core of the mod is a new class and skill system for Heroes 3. To avoid bugs neraly the complete WoG mod has been rewritten. Making ACM very stable. 
Now it is possible to play three very distinct classes, each with their own strengths and weaknesses.

- New Master and Grandmaster level for every Secondary Skill
- Greatly improve the usefulness of weaker skills
- 3 main Hero classes (Warrior, Mage and Adventurer) 
- 3 completely new hybrid classes (Battlemage, Hunter and Druid)
- New unique abilities for every class at the highest level
- Reworked nearly all Hero specializations, including creature, spell and adventurer specialists
- Reworked Primary and Secondary skill point chance at level up for each class
- Completely reworked the Magic-System, now all spells scale with Spell Power and much more
- New Master and Grandmaster level for every combat spell, with new effects and powers
- Reworked Commander abilities, they are now much more combat active and actually fun to use
- Most artifacts are improved and are part of a set with interesting bonuses
- Added 3 new secret class sets
- New settings for increased difficulty of Neutral Units and computer players (AI)
- Good compatibility with WoG options


 2. Important Informations
 
- Inside the mod folder, you can find help files that will explain most changes and things you might want to know. Especially for the Difficult options its important to read them. All options provide additional information when right-clicked ingame.
- Right and left-click on Hero Portrait in hero-screen will show you important information about your current class points and skills, which determine your hero development. Use this often!
- Correct color of skills and artifact sets:
Depending on which version of the HD mod you use, you have to set the correct color mode for the colors to work correct ingame.
If you use the newest gaming assembly from Daemon_n (which I strongly recommend) and work with the HD mod Version 5 please set this video-mode in HD-Mod launcher:
(stretchable) 16-bit OpenGL by Verok
resolution I recommend 1180x664 and any filter.
You will notice the correct settings if secondary skill descrioptions have a red name. If they have a yellow name, colors are not working as intendet!
- If you press F12 in-game, for whatever reason. Save and Reload game to restore proper skill/artifact descriptions.


 2.1 Brief Overview of some important changes or difference to WoG mechanics
 
Heroes:
- most heroes specializations have been reworked and significantly improved in their usefulnes, especially magic heroes, there are also some new and unique specialities. Every hero should now be "mainable". Scaling per level decreased to 3% instead of 5%. Some heroes have changed starting secondary skills to better match their speciality. 

Artifacts:
- new unique effects for unused are boring artifacts added, also introduced new artifact sets. Set boni dont require the complete set anymore, however the strongest boni still needs the complete set. Also changed to class of several artifacts.

Warmachines:
- cleaned up the mess with the buggy Warmachine scripts 1,2,3. Now only 1 Warmachine of each type and no more 20 Ballistas nonsense. Tents now resurrect but have a limited heal power, tied to your army strength, indicated by the "damage" value from your tent. Ammo Carts and Ballistas improved. You can buy over 20 unique upgrades for your WM in the towns. 

Spells:
- by far the most work went into the rework of the magic system. Now all spells scale with spell power! The strength of your spells is dependant of your characters Magic Strength (MS), a new primary stat introduced in ACM. Caster heroes are now clearly better spellcasters than a Tazar with Earth Magic. Reduced the power of the Slow spell and moved to level 3. Spell point costs increased. Mulitcasting in the same battleround will increase spell point costs until the next battleround. 

Commanders:
- disabled most of the old WoG commander features and remade them. Commanders now require at least 1 point in Magic skill to be able to cast. Spells are made much more useful, read description. All Commanders now profit from carring out actual attacks in combat, some can even increase their damage or health permanently by killing whole squads.

Fire Shield:
- Returned damage is now additionaly dependant on your Spell Power and can exceede the original damage amount, this gives much more tactical depth to this spell. Some creatures are now immune to Fire Shield, like Dragons and other fire affinite units.  

Summoning Elementals:
- HP of summons is now dependant on your MS, also summons can grant buffs to your army while alive on the battlefield. Summoing Air is available early but therefore very weak.

Eagle Eye:
- Spells are now learned directly in combat. And some more goodies are on this skill.

Luck/Morale:
- Morale now cappes at +6, each point of Morale increases you chance to gain extra move by ~3%. Luck increased to +6 max but damage scaling for Luck>6. Chance to land a lucky hit is capped by 15%. At some point only the damage of your Luck hits will increase. Check out the new window in the Heros Screen.

Diplomacy:
- Reworked complete skills. Now gives a chance to attract creatures from your actual army, you can directly hire them for an increased price. This makes Diplomacy more useful and predictable, also it cannot happen that a random free join of thousands neutrals give you an insta win.

Navigation:
- Skill deleted and replaced with Nobility skill. Nobility can increase creature growth in towns.

Creatures stats and Town lineups
- no changes were made to creatures or towns. I'll leave that to other mods.


 3. How to play this mod?
 
Just play a normal H3 game but it is recommended to decide early on which class your hero should reach. If you play the standard 8 secondary skill game, you need 35 points to reach Master Class and 58 points for Grandmaster, but you can always check. 
Each Master skill gives 2 class points! Master and Grandmaster skills can only be learned if you are M/GM in that class.
To do this check your class points often and calculate how many points you get from secondary skills to reach a certain class. Check your progression/class points after every hero level up.
Please check the Readme about AI difficulty before game start. It is recommended to skip Difficulty settings in your first game to get used to the mod. 


 4. Maybe frequently asked questions
 
- Which WoG settings can I use?
Answer: Feel free to use any setting you like. There are no specific ACM settings you need to activate. Incompatible settings are mostly disabled. If some setting is not working please report, so it can be fixed. 

- In Hero Screen why does is say "Skill Exp. Leadershi" and not Expert Leadership as it used to be? 
Answer: To simulate the two new levels of every skill, for me, it was not possible to keep it the old way. Thats the price you pay, but you get used to it after one or two games :)

- Why can't I level up some skills to Master?
Answer: You dont have enough class points to get offered Master level for that skill. Check your current class points and level.

- What happens if I learn a secondary skill and later forget it? Will I keep all bonuses?
Answer: No. When you unlearn secondary skills, you will lose M/GM level and maybe even drop out of your current class.

- What happens if I play with more then 10 secondary skills?
Answer: You can try, but ACM does not support it. With more than 10 skills it will be much easier to reach several classes at once, making very strong heroes. Overall should work, but I dont know what happens. 

- What does Magic Strength do?
Answer: It is a new stat for mainly caster Heroes which ensures that they are realy better casters than Warrior Heroes. The power of some spells now depend on your MS and not on your Spell Power. 1 SP equals 1 MS, also several secondary skills give you MS. - Magic Strength scaling factor for big and small maps (XXL-Maps 80%, XL-Maps 85%, L-Maps 100, M-Map 110% S-Maps 120%, this ensures somewhat similar power of spells on all map sizes)

- I really like the Spell Trainer option but I think the damage increase per level is to low, can that be changed?
Answer: Yes, in the erm file just search for damage increment and change for example from 2% to 5%. Now each level up for damage spells will give you +5% damage.

- Can I use THIS or THAT mod together with AC Mod?
Answer: Most probably yes, just try it out. What usually happens is that skill descriptions are overwritten, but in most cases the effect will still work/apply. 

- I have seen pictures of new cool Upgrades and even Enchantments for Warmachines. How can I aquire them?
Answer: For Upgrades right-click Blacksmith in town, for Enchantments right-click your Mage Guild. 

- The game is now too easy/difficult now -_-
Answer: I gave you all the options to tune difficulty to your likings, just check the readme what each option does. So if your game is to easy, ramp up the difficulty.

- I saw you increased Offense damage from 30% to 31% and Eagle Eye now deals damage before the combat LOL, also you disabled my favorite WoG option ROFL, isn't your mod a completely fail?
Answer: If you asked these questions maybe its time you start modding your own game. This modification is a product of several years modding Heroes 3 WoG. I tried to keep all fun mechanics which WoG gave us but some of them have to be disabled because they are simple OP and make it impossible to deliver a coherent mod as a whole. 
Examples are the "Warmachine scripts", the "Hero Specialisation script", the "Commander Abilities" and some "artifact and secondary skills scripts". I have rewritten all of the mentioned scripts from scratch, tuned them down and added new stuff which I think is better than the originals. If you cannot live without with one of the options disabled you can kindly ask and I will "reenable" them for you. 

- LOL Perry this Battle Commander option is a joke I always have to reload and the Battle Reward option makes the game to easy.
Answer: Well nobody foces you to use these options. They have a scaling which depends on your hero level and army power, so they should never be to strong or to weak. Battle Commander is doable and a nice addition in my opinion. 
Did you know that you can disable the Battle Commander option during your game by right-clicking the system icon menu, make new settings and disable the Battle Commander, and after the fight you can again make new settings to enable it again. Problem solved. 

- I activated the "Grwoth Beyond 4000" option and now I face 20k Peasants which I cant defeat and finish my map, any idea?
Answer: well well you are a noob! Right-Click System option Icon on Adventure screen. Make new settings. Disable the "Growth Beyond 4000" option. Fight the (now only) 4000 Peasants. After that fight activate the option "Growth Beyond 4000" again, problem solved.

- What is the Warrior class?
Answer: Good understanding of combat tactics and strategies the warrior itself increases the damage of his troops with his great combat knowledge. He also boasts the morale and luck of his troops. On the highest ranks, his troops will do insane damage with attacks.

- What is the Mage class?
Answer: The mage boost the stats of his creatures with strong defense spells. By studying all elements he has access to powerful combat spells which he can cast several times to destroy his enemies. Fight the mage as soon as you can or his magic will become unstoppable.

- What is the Adventurer class?
Answer: Adventurer: The adventurer is a swift explorer and no one is faster than him. He strengthens the hit points of his troops in combat and with his knowledge of first aid and spiritual magic he will resurrect his fallen troops after every fight. He is also excellent in managing his kingdom. On grandmaster level, his army will outnumber any other army in Erathia.


Additional Infos about integrated mods can be found in the mod folder eg. like changes to Starting Heroes, Neutral and AI Difficulty, Spell Changes! some formulas (later) and more...
Please deactivate all of my other "Enhanced Magic Skills" mod, they are all integrated. 
The mod is intended to be played with only 8 hero secondary skills. If you want to play with 10 I recommend Igriks 10 Sec Skills Mod, if you use that please DEACTIVATE Secondary Skill Scrolling Mod. Playing with 10 skills makes it easier to reach Class Ranks, but points will be adjusted.


5. Known Bugs:
- In two hero meeting screen, some secondary skills are displayed wrong
- Pressing F12 will mess up skill and artifact descriptions. Please save and reload to restore.
- Wells will show incorrect amount of Spell Points recovered
- AOE damage spells can show wrong damage in battle log, but the increased damage is calculated correct.

**********************************************************************************************


*Rework of Fire Shield:
Tried to greatly improve the fun and use of Fire Shield spell.
The problem with that spell was that it actually required your troops to take damage to have any usefulness, also it was very difficult to calculate the reflected damage because it also depends on attack and defense value of the hero. Also, several creatures which should be immune to Fire Shield damage were not.

The new Fire Shield now is more like a spell and the damage depends on the spell power of your hero. The new formula for reflected damage is:
10% of melee damage +20*SP+50 with no magic school.
Sorcery, Fire Magic, Orb of Fire, Resistance, Protection from Fire all in the damage formula now.  Also, several creatures are now completely immune to Fire Shield, like Black Dragons.
These changes make the spell much more useful early on and it is not so big pain to fight Effret-Sultans anymore. Remember it is a level 4 spell now.
