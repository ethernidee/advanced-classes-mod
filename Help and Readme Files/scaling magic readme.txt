Scaling Magic

Check your current value of Magic Strength by right-clicking the knowledge icon in your hero screen.

You ever felt that it made no sense that a level 5 hero can cast Stoneskin with the same effect than a mighty level 50 wizard? 
This Mod gives nearly all spells a scaling with spell power which hadn't one before! The effect of the spell is now based on your heroes total "Magic Strength" [MS]
MS is a combination of the hero spell power and his magic based secondary skills. 
If you now pick Sorcery as a secondary skill it will give you +10 MS at expert level. +10 to MS will most likely result in one extra level for most of your spells. So no more buffing damage spells only.
A lot of other magic skills as wisdom, scholar or the magic schools will give you a certain amount to you MS. This system prevents strong might heroes, which happen to have high spell power, 
from gaining the same strong spells as a pure magic hero will get! 

To keep balance all spells start at a lower level. At around 20 to 30 MS factor you will get the same values as original H3 spells. But after that value, your spells will become stronger the more spell power you have.
Higher level spells will cost more spell points when cast. The spell points will be reduced from your mana pool after casting the spell. This makes it more important for casting heroes to take care of their spell points.

To check the current power of your spell you can right click on your heroes spell bock.
